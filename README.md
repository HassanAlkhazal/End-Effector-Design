# End-Effector-Design
This end effector is designed to use in the balloon robot. The shape of the designed looks like as an arrow. It will help the robot to explode the balloon quickly and in smooth motion. The rotation of the arrow is designed to have an impact against the opponent to explode the balloon at difficult angles. The design is created with accurate dimensions according to the motor dimensions and the specified dimensions of the robot.  There are three parts has designed: 1. Base. 2. Cover Plate. 3. Shaft and an Arrow. The dimensions of each part are in the attachment. The analysis of the parts as follow:

1. Base:
It has designed to mount in the motor in the arm 2, and its function to move the end effector either up or down. It is also designed to have a place for the motor, which responsible for the rotation motion of the end-effector.  
2. Cover Plate:
It is designed to cover the base part, and it contains an open circle in the middle to allow the shaft to be driven by the motor. 
3. Shaft and an Arrow:
This is the end-effector where the shaft is attached with the arrow to transfer the rotation movement and to hold it.
